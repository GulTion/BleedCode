1.  **Game State Visualization:**
    *   **Board Display:** A clear visual representation of the game board (e.g., chessboard, Go board) showing the operator and oprend positions exactly as they were at a specific point (state) in the game.
    *   **State Information:** Display relevant context like whose turn it is, captured pieces, game clock time (if applicable), operator , etc., for the selected state.

2.  **Game Navigation & Playback:**
    *   **Move List:** A scrollable list showing all the moves played in the game sequence. Clicking on a move instantly jumps the board display to the state *after* that move was made.
    *   **Timeline/Slider:** A visual slider representing the game's progression, allowing the user to quickly scrub through the game.
    *   **Playback Controls:** Standard buttons like:
        *   `Play/Pause`: Automatically step through moves.
        *   `Next Move (>)`: Advance one step forward in the game history.
        *   `Previous Move (<)`: Go one step backward in the game history.
        *   `Go to Start (<<)`: Jump to the initial position.
        *   `Go to End (>>)`: Jump to the final position of the game.
    *   **Current Move Indication:** Clearly highlight the move in the move list and/or on the board that led *to* the currently displayed state (or the move *about* to be played *from* the current state, depending on convention).

3.  **Played Move Analysis (Effectiveness):**
    *   **Highlight Actual Move:** When viewing state `N`, clearly indicate the move that was *actually played* by the user (or player) to reach state `N+1`.
    *   **Effectiveness Indicator:** Provide an assessment of how good that *actual* move was. This typically requires comparison against an engine's evaluation:
        *   **Symbolic Notation:** Use common symbols (often seen in chess annotation): `!!` (Brilliant), `!` (Good), `!?` (Interesting), `?!` (Dubious), `?` (Mistake), `??` (Blunder).
        *   **Color Coding:** Color the move in the move list or on the board (e.g., Green for good, Yellow for inaccuracy, Red for blunder).
        *   **Score Delta:** Show the change in evaluation score (e.g., centipawns in chess) caused by the move compared to the best possible move. A large negative drop indicates a poor move.
        *   **Descriptive Text:** Simple labels like "Best Move," "Excellent," "Inaccuracy," "Mistake," "Blunder."

4.  **Optimal Solution Display (Best Move from Current State):**
    *   **Engine Integration:** The component must interface with a game analysis engine (e.g., Stockfish for Chess, KataGo for Go).
    *   **Best Move Calculation:** For the *currently displayed state*, the engine calculates the optimal move(s).
    *   **Solution Visualization:** Display the engine's recommended best move(s) directly on the board, often using distinct arrows or highlighted squares.
    *   **Engine Evaluation Score:** Show the engine's score (e.g., +1.50 meaning White is better by 1.5 pawns in chess) associated with the best move(s) from the *current* state.
    *   **Principal Variation (PV):** Often, the component will show not just the best immediate move, but the sequence of moves the engine expects to follow (the PV) for a certain depth.

**In summary, the component allows a user to:**

1.  **Navigate** to any point ("instant") in the game using controls or the move list.
2.  **See** the board state and the specific move that *was* played at that point.
3.  **Understand** how *effective* that played move was (e.g., blunder, good move) based on engine analysis.
4.  **Discover** what the *best possible* move ("solution") was from that exact same board state, as suggested by the analysis engine, along with its expected outcome/evaluation.

This creates a powerful learning tool, enabling users to pinpoint their mistakes, understand why they were mistakes, and learn the better alternatives.
